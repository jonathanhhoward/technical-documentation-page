        <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For
            example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
            and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its
            functions.</p>

    <section id="So_what_is_HTML&quest;" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>So what is HTML?</h1></header>
        <p>HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
            HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to
            make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to
            somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the
            following line of content:</p>
        <code class="block-code">My cat is very grumpy</code>
        <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in
            paragraph tags:</p>
        <code class="block-code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
    </section>
    <section id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_element" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2></header>
        <p>Let's explore this paragraph element a bit further.</p>
        <code class="block-code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The opening tag</strong>: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in
                opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in
                this case where the paragraph begins.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The closing tag</strong>: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward
                slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph
                ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange
                results.
            </li>
            <li><strong>The content</strong>: This is the content of the element, which in this case is just text.</li>
            <li><strong>The element</strong>: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the
                element.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
        <code class="block-code">&lt;p class="editor-note"&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content.
            Here, <code>class</code> is the attribute name, and <code>editor-note</code> is the attribute value. The
            <code>class</code> attribute allows you to give the element an identifier that can be used later to target
            the element with style information and other things.</p>
        <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or
                more attributes).
            </li>
            <li>The attribute name, followed by an equals sign.</li>
            <li>The attribute value, wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
        </ol>
        <i>Note: Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters <code>"
            ' ` = < ></code> ) can remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values, as it
            makes the code more consistent and understandable.</i>
    </section>
    <section id="Nesting_elements" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Nesting elements</h2></header>
        <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat
            is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element, which means that the
            word is to be strongly emphasized:</p>
        <code class="block-code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <p>You do however need to make sure that your elements are properly nested: in the example above, we opened the
            <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element first, then the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element; therefore, we have to
            close the <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> element first, then the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element. The
            following is incorrect:</p>
        <code class="block-code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is &lt;strong&gt;very grumpy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;</code>
        <p>The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one another. If they
            overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess at what you were trying to
            say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Empty_elements" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Empty elements</h2></header>
        <p>Some elements have no content and are called empty elements. Take the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element that
            we
            already have in our HTML page:</p>
        <code class="block-code">&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>
        <p>This contains two attributes, but there is no closing <code>&lt;/img&gt;</code> tag and no inner content.
            This is because an image element doesn't wrap content to affect it. Its purpose is to embed an image in
            the HTML page in the place it appears.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Anatomy_of_an_HTML_document" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Anatomy of an HTML document</h2></header>
        <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll look at
            how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page:</p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
    &lt;title>My test page&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Here, we have the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> — The doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around
                1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be
                considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these
                days no one cares about them, and they are just a historical artifact that needs to be included for
                everything to work right. For now, that's all you need to know.
            </li>
            <li><code>&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;</code> — the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element. This element wraps all
                the content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.
            </li>
            <li><code>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</code> — the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element. This element acts as a
                container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing
                to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to
                appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, and more.
            </li>
            <li><code>&lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;</code> — This element sets the character set your document should
                use to UTF-8, which includes most characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially,
                it can now handle any textual content you might put on it. There is no reason not to set this, and it
                can help avoid some problems later on.
            </li>
            <li><code>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</code> — the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> element. This sets the title
                of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab the page is loaded in. It is also used
                to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.
            </li>
            <li><code>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</code> — the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element. This contains all the
                content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page, whether that's text, images,
                videos, games, playable audio tracks, or whatever else.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <hr>
    <section id="Images" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>Images</h1></header>
        <p>Let's turn our attention to the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element again:</p>
        <code class="block-code">&lt;img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"&gt;</code>
        <p>As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the
            <code>src</code> (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.</p>
        <p>We have also included an <code>alt</code> (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify
            descriptive text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen
                readers to read out the alt text to them.
            </li>
            <li>Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing the
                path inside your <code>src</code> attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you
                should see something like this in place of the image:
            </li>
        </ol>
        <figure><img src="images/firefox-icon.png" alt="My test image"></figure>
        <p>The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader with
            enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current text of
            "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox
            logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."</p>

    <section id="Marking_up_text" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>Marking up text</h1></header>
        <p>This section will cover some of the essential HTML elements you'll use for marking up the text.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Headings" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Headings</h2></header>
        <p>Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or subheadings. In
            the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles, and subtitles, an HTML document can too. HTML
            contains 6 heading levels, <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code>–<code>&lt;h6&gt;</code>, although you'll commonly only
            use 3 to 4 at most:</p>
        <pre><code class="block-code">&lt;h1&gt;My main title&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My top level heading&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My subheading&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;My sub-subheading&lt;/h4&gt;</code></pre>
        <i>Note: You'll see that your heading level 1 has an implicit style. Don't use heading elements to make
            text bigger or bold, because they are used for accessibility and other reasons such as SEO. Try to
            create a meaningful sequence of headings on your pages, without skipping levels.</i>
    </section>
    <section id="Paragraphs" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Paragraphs</h2></header>
        <p>As explained above, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements are for containing paragraphs of text; you'll use these
            frequently when marking up regular text content:</p>
        <code class="block-code">&lt;p&gt;This is a single paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</code>
    </section>
    <section id="Lists" class="main-section">
        <header><h2>Lists</h2></header>
        <p>A lot of the web's content is lists, and HTML has special elements for these. Marking up lists always consist
            of at least 2 elements. The most common list types are ordered and unordered lists:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Unordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items doesn't matter, such as a
                shopping list. These are wrapped in a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Ordered lists</strong> are for lists where the order of the items does matter, such as a recipe.
                These are wrapped in an <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> element.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Each item inside the lists is put inside an <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> (list item) element.</p>
        <p>For example, if we wanted to turn the part of the following paragraph fragment into a list</p>
        <code class="block-code">&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of technologists, thinkers, and builders
            working together... &lt;/p&gt;</code>
        <p>We could modify the markup to this</p>

        <pre><code class="block-code">&lt;p&gt;At Mozilla, we’re a global community of&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;technologists&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;thinkers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;builders&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;working together ... &lt;/p&gt;</code></pre>

    <section id="Links" class="main-section">
        <header><h1>Links</h1></header>
        <a>Links are very important — they are what makes the web a web! To add a link, we need to use a simple element
            — <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> — "a" being the short form for "anchor". To make text within your paragraph into a
            link, follow these steps:</a>
        <ol>
            <li>Choose some text. We chose the text "Mozilla Manifesto".</li>
            <li>Wrap the text in an <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element, as shown below:<br>
                <code class="block-code">&lt;a&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
            <li>Give the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element an <code>href</code> attribute, as shown below:<br>
                <code class="block-code">&lt;a href=""&gt;Mozilla Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
            <li>Fill in the value of this attribute with the web address that you want the link to link to:<br>
                <code class="block-code">&lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/"&gt;Mozilla
                    Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;</code></li>
        </ol>
        <p>You might get unexpected results if you omit the <code>https://</code> or <code>http://</code> part, called
            the protocol, at the beginning of the web address. After making a link, click it to make sure it is sending
            you where you wanted it to.</p>
        <i>Note: <code>href</code> might appear like a rather obscure choice for an attribute name at first. If you are
            having trouble remembering it, remember that it stands for hypertext reference.</i>
